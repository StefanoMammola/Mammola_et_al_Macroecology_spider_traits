# Mammola_et_al_Macroecology_spider_traits

R code to generate the analysis in:

Scripts are divided in S1-Sx, where: 

S1 - Runs the code to standardize taxonomic names.
S2 - Runs the code to prepare matrices for BBGDM, including the principal coordinate analysis and the extracting of regional variables from raster files. 
S3 - runs null models for beta diversity values and applies BBGDM to null matrices to estimate standardized effect sizes of Wald values.
