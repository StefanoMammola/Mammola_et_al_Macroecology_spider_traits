R code to reproduce the analysis in:

Mammola, S. et al. 2024. Functional convergence underground? The scale-dependency of community assembly processes in European cave spiders. Global ecology and biogeography.

Scripts are divided into S1-S5, as detailed below. Note that scripts S3 and S4 need to be run on a supercomputer.

S1 - Runs the code to standardize taxonomic names.

S2 - Runs the code to prepare matrices for analysis, including the principal coordinate analysis and the extraction of regional variables from raster files. 

S3 - Runs null models for beta diversity values and applies BBGDM to null matrices to estimate standardized effect sizes of Wald values.

S4 - Calculate SES for alpha

S5 - Runs final analyses and generates figures
